## Overview

BloodHound uses graph theory to reveal hidden and often unintended relationships within Active Directory or Azure environments. Attackers use BloodHound to identify complex attack paths quickly. Defenders leverage it to identify and eliminate these same attack paths.

The SOAR integration with SpecterOps BloodHound enables defenders to see all attack path findings as Splunk SOAR events. Additionally, the app provides actions to remediate and remove these attack paths.
